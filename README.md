# Automated Particle Detection in AFM Images of Environmental Films

## Overview
This repository provides the Python implementations of the two particle-detection algorithms described in the manuscript "Automated Particle Detection in AFM Images of Environmental Films Using Two Novel Algorithms". Both algorithms operate on AFM height images and output binary particle masks.

## Contents
- `algorithm_a.py`: Implementation of Algorithm A
- `algorithm_b.py`: Implementation of Algorithm B

Required packages: `numpy`, `opencv-python`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-image`, `igor2`
